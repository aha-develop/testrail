# [Prototype] TestRail extension for Aha! Develop

This is a prototype extension to integrate TestRail with Aha! Develop. It relies on the [Webhooks](https://support.testrail.com/hc/en-us/articles/7169038183572-Webhooks) functionality from TestRail. Unfortunately these webhooks do not provide sufficient data to create a useful extension as of August 2022 – namely, they do not include actual test results. We have paused work on this extension until TestRail provides the functionality we need.

We are opting to make this repo public to provide guidance to anyone attempting to create their own extension. This code is not formally supported by Aha!
